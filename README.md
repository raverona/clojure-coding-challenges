A clojure and algorithms study.

# Context

`clojure-coding-challenges` is a Clojure library with functions that implement the coding challenges contained in the [CRACKING the CODING INTERVIEW](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) book.

The ideia is to have at least two implementations: 

1. The most idiomatic one;
2. One without using any shortcuts;

Calculating their run time and space complexity, [using big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), 
and at least two kinds of tests: 

1. One using a declative approach; 
2. One using a generative approach;

The purpose of this repository is to study clojure, and alrorithms at the same time.
